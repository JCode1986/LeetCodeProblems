### Problem Domain
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Inputs and Expected Outputs

#### Example 1:  
| Input | Expected Output |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| [2,2,1] | 1 |

#### Example 2:  
| Input | Expected Output |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| [4,1,2,1,2] | 4 |
